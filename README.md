# odin-recipes
I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Recipes" is the very first project in the Foundations course, which tests basic HTML to create a website with various recipes. Knowledge tested includes project structure, text formatting, links, images, and lists.

Original source of the recipes can be found [here](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
