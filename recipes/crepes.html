    <h3>
      <u> Ingredients </u>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
      <li> 2 large eggs </li>
      <li> ½ cups of milk </li>
      <li> ½ cups of water </li>
      <li> ¼ teaspoons of salt </li>
      <li> 2 tablespoons of butter, melted </li>
      <li>
        <em>Optional: </em> fruits, chocolate syrup, food dye
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <u> Directions </u>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Whisk flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth. Add a few drops of food dye if you wish to colour your crêpes. </li>
      <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly. </li>
      <li> Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot, adding fruits and chocolate syrup as desired. </li>
    </ol>
